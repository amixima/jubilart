# Non-Technical Deployment Guide for Art Community Platform

This guide is designed for non-programmers who need to deploy the Art Community Platform. It provides simple, step-by-step instructions using managed services that require minimal technical knowledge.

## Option 1: Using Vercel (Easiest Method)

Vercel is a platform that makes deploying Next.js applications very simple, even for non-programmers.

### Step 1: Create a Vercel Account

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "Sign Up" and create an account (you can use GitHub, GitLab, or email)

### Step 2: Prepare Your Project

1. Download the project files as a ZIP from your developer
2. Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer

### Step 3: Upload to GitHub (Optional but Recommended)

If you're not familiar with GitHub, you can ask your developer to help with this step or use Vercel's direct upload option.

1. Create a GitHub account at [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Create a new repository
3. Upload the project files to this repository

### Step 4: Deploy on Vercel

1. Log in to your Vercel account
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository (or use "Upload" if you skipped Step 3)
4. Keep the default settings and click "Deploy"
5. Wait for the deployment to complete (usually takes 1-2 minutes)
6. Vercel will provide you with a URL where your site is live (e.g., your-project.vercel.app)

### Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

1. In your Vercel dashboard, go to your project
2. Click on "Settings" → "Environment Variables"
3. Add the following variables (get these values from your developer):
   - `AUTH_SECRET` (a random string for security)
   - `DATABASE_URL` (connection string to your database)
   - Any OAuth credentials if you're using social login

### Step 6: Connect a Custom Domain (Optional)

1. In your Vercel project, go to "Settings" → "Domains"
2. Add your domain name
3. Follow Vercel's instructions to update your DNS settings

## Option 2: Using Cloudflare Pages

Cloudflare Pages is another user-friendly option for deploying web applications.

### Step 1: Create a Cloudflare Account

1. Go to [cloudflare.com](https://cloudflare.com)
2. Sign up for an account

### Step 2: Set Up Cloudflare Pages

1. In your Cloudflare dashboard, click on "Pages"
2. Click "Create a project"
3. Connect your GitHub account (or upload files directly)
4. Select your repository
5. Configure your build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Build output directory: `.next`
6. Click "Save and Deploy"

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

1. In your Pages project, go to "Settings" → "Environment variables"
2. Add the same variables as mentioned in Option 1, Step 5

## Option 3: Hiring a DevOps Professional

If you're not comfortable with the above options:

1. Consider hiring a DevOps professional on platforms like Upwork or Fiverr
2. Share this project and the detailed deployment documentation with them
3. They can set up the hosting and deployment pipeline for you

## Database Setup

For the database, the easiest option is to use a managed database service:

### Using Neon (PostgreSQL)

1. Go to [neon.tech](https://neon.tech)
2. Create an account and a new project
3. Create a new database
4. Copy the connection string
5. Add this as the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in your hosting platform

## Ongoing Maintenance

### Updates and Backups

1. Regularly back up your database (most managed services do this automatically)
2. When you have updates to the platform, repeat the deployment process with the new files

### Monitoring

1. Use the built-in analytics in Vercel or Cloudflare to monitor traffic
2. Set up email notifications for any downtime

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues during deployment:

1. Take screenshots of any error messages
2. Contact your developer with these screenshots
3. Consider using the support services offered by Vercel or Cloudflare

## Estimated Costs

- Vercel: Free tier available, Pro plan starts at $20/month
- Cloudflare Pages: Free tier available
- Database hosting: Free tier available on Neon, paid plans start around $10/month
- Custom domain: $10-15 per year

This should give you a good starting point for deploying your art community platform without requiring programming knowledge.
